    <h2>Baking Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 500ÂºF, allowing it to reach the ideal temperature for our exquisite delights.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, carefully combine the unbleached artisanal flour with baking soda and sea salt, ensuring a
            harmonious fusion of flavors. Set aside this mixture, treating it with utmost respect.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened European-style butter with the organic cane sugar and packed
            organic brown sugar, using medium speed until the blend becomes creamy and radiates a delightful lightness in
            color.</li>
        <li>Introduce the eggs from our serene, classically inspired chickens, one at a time, into the mixture. Allow each
            egg to be incorporated fully at a low speed, creating a symphony of flavors.</li>
        <li>Gradually and gracefully blend the reserved dry mixture into the creamed mixture, ensuring every particle is
            enveloped by the essence of our passion. Stir in the finely chopped almonds or hazelnuts, if desired, and the
            indulgent Blissful Bites Signature 70% Cacao Chocolate Chunks.</li>
        <li>With an artistic touch, drop each tablespoonful of our divine dough onto ungreased baking sheets, as if
            painting strokes of perfection onto a canvas.</li>
        <li>Bake with reverence for 9 to 11 minutes or until our chocolate-infused wonders emerge with a golden hue,
            inviting you to savor their essence.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool briefly, and then experience the sheer bliss of each bite, as the flavors dance upon
            your palate, whispering tales of culinary excellence and the finest ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Indulge in the symphony of flavors and savor the exquisiteness of Blissful Bites Delights!</p>
